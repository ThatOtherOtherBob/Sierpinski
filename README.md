# This is a demo project that draws a Sierpinski triangle

v1.0.0
Created

v1.0.1
Fixed error where this compiled locally, but not when uploaded to BlitHub.
Adjusted to render to 320x240 instead of 320x200.
Adjusted to paint to a buffer and refresh from the buffer instead of paint on button-press so redraw happens immediately on the home-menu closing.
Turned enum to enum class to get rid of warning.
Removed a few magic numbers.

v1.0.2
Fixed typo (Thanks to deshipu for finding it)
